The LaunchDarkly platform was built to guide engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:


* Improving the velocity and stability of software releases, without the fear of end customer outages
* Delivering targeted experiences by easily personalizing features to customer cohorts
* Maximizing the business impact of every feature through the ability to experiment and optimize
* Coordinating the release and optimization of software to provide consistent experiences across mobile platforms and device types
* Improving the effectiveness and productivity of engineering teams, by providing insights into engineering cadence and stability

About Us

Created by Humans is a groundbreaking AI Rights licensing platform that connects creators with AI developers, enabling the licensing of copyrighted works for AI training and reference uses. Our platform aims to protect copyright owners’ rights while fostering innovation in AI.

Created by Humans is built on our founding team’s extensive experience in the digital publishing, technology, and data infrastructure sectors. Trip Adler, our CEO, previously founded Scribd, where he pioneered the subscription model for books. We’re the official partner of the Authors Guild, the nation’s oldest and largest organization for 14,000+ writers.

We’ve raised $10 million in seed financing from David Sacks’ Craft Ventures, Mike Maples, Jr. at Floodgate, YCombinator CEO, Garry Tan, and bestselling author Walter Isaacson. We have already hired several senior engineers (ex-Google, ex-Snap, ex-Rubrik) and are looking to expand our team. Over 50 authors have tested our product in beta, including Douglas Preston, Susan Orlean, Lincoln Child, and others. We made a collaboration agreement with one of the largest author associations in the US and are about to sign an agreement with one of the Big Five publishers in the US.

Technical Challenge

We’re building a large-scale system to curate, store and deliver content from multiple industries (publishing, video, websites, etc.)to AI companies. One of our technical challenges is reconciling all stakeholders for various content and implementing a complex payout system so the value could flow back from AI Companies to all content creation stakeholders.

Team and Technologies

We’re building a team of seasoned senior engineers, where each member shows technical excellence and a high level of ownership. We’d like to stay lean and flat for as long as possible. Our primary backend language is Python, and we’re deployed on AWS; for our web app, we use TypeScript, React, Tailwind, NextJS, and Radix UI. Eventually, we’ll also train models ourselves and/or build consumer applications.

Compensation

We offer generous equity, competitive salaries, health insurance, 401k, and lunches for in-office days.

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.
